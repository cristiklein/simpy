===================
SimPy in 10 Minutes
===================


In this section, you'll learn the basics of SimPy in just a few minutes.
Afterwards, you will be able to implement a simple simulation using SimPy and
you'll be able to make an educated decision if SimPy is what you need. We'll
also give you some hints on how to proceed to implement more complex
simulations.

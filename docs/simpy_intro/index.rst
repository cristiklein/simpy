SimPy in 10 Minutes
===================


In this section, you'll learn the basics of SimPy in just a few minutes. You
will be able to implement a simple simulation using SimPy and you'll be able
to make an educated decision if SimPy is what you need. We'll also give you
some hints on how to proceed to implement more complex simulations.

How to Proceed
==============

If you are not certain yet if SimPy fulfills your requirements or if you want
to see more features in action, you should take a look at the various
:doc:`examples <../examples/index>` we provide.

If you are looking for a more detailed description of a certain aspect or
feature of SimPy, the :doc:`Topical Guides <../topical_guides/index>` section
might help you.

Finally, there is an :doc:`API Reference <../api_reference/index>` that
describes all functions and classes in full detail.

SimPy History & Change Log
==========================

SimPy was originally based on ideas from Simula and Simscript but uses standard
Python. It combines two previous packages, SiPy, in Simula-Style (Klaus Müller)
and SimPy, in Simscript style (Tony Vignaux and Chang Chui).

SimPy was based on efficient implementation of co-routines using Python's
generators capability.

SimPy 3 introduced a completely new and easier-to-use API, but still relied on
Python's generators as they proved to work very well.

The package has been hosted on Sourceforge.net since September 15th, 2002.
In June 2012, the project moved to Bitbucket.org.


3.0.2 – 2013-10-24
==================

- [FIX] The default capacity for ``Container`` and ``FilterStore`` is now also
  ``inf``.


3.0.1 – 2013-10-24
==================

- [FIX] Documentation and default parameters of ``Store`` didn't match. Its
  default capacity is now ``inf``.


3.0 – 2013-10-11
================

SimPy 3 has been completely rewritten from scratch. Our main goals were to
simplify the API and code base as well as making SimPy more flexible and
extensible. Some of the most important changes are:

- Stronger focus on events. Processes yield event instances and are suspended
  until the event is triggered. An example for an event is a *timeout*
  (formerly known as *hold*), but even processes are now events, too (you can
  wait until a process terminates).

- Events can be combined with ``&`` (and) and ``|`` (or) to create
  *condition events*.

- Process can now be defined by any generator function. You don't have to
  subclass ``Process`` anymore.

- No more global simulation state. Every simulation stores its state in an
  *environment* which is comparable to the old ``Simulation`` class.

- Improved resource system with newly added resource types.

- Removed plotting and GUI capabilities. `Pyside`__ and `matplotlib`__ are much
  better with this.

- Greatly improved test suite. Its cleaner, and the tests are shorter and more
  numerous.

- Completely overhauled documentation.

There is a `guide for porting from SimPy 2 to SimPy 3`__. If you want to stick
to SimPy 2 for a while, change your requirements to ``'SimPy>=2.3,<3'``.

All in all, SimPy has become a framework for asynchronous programming based on
coroutines. It brings more than ten years of experience and scientific know-how
in the field of event-discrete simulation to the world of asynchronous
programming and should thus be a solid foundation for everything based on an
event loop.

2.3.1 – 2012-01-28
==================

- [NEW] More improvements on the documentation.
- [FIX] Syntax error in tkconsole.py when installing on Py3.2.
- [FIX] Added *mock* to the dep. list in SimPy.test().


2.3 – 2011-12-24
================

- [NEW] Support for Python 3.2. Support for Python <= 2.5 has been dropped.
- [NEW] SimPy.test() method to run the tests on the installed version of SimPy.
- [NEW] Tutorials/examples were integrated into the test suite.
- [CHANGE] Even more code clean-up (e.g., removed prints throughout the code,
  removed if-main-blocks, ...).
- [CHANGE] Many documentation improvements.


2.2 – 2011-09-27
================

- [CHANGE] Restructured package layout to be conform to the `Hitchhiker’s Guide
  to packaging <http://guide.python-distribute.org/>`_
- [CHANGE] Tests have been ported to pytest.
- [CHANGE] Documentation improvements and clean-ups.
- [FIX] Fixed incorrect behavior of Store._put, thanks to Johannes Koomer for
  the fix.


2.1 – 2010-06-03
================

- [NEW] A function *step* has been added to the API. When called, it executes
  the next scheduled event. (*step* is actually a method of *Simulation*.)
- [NEW] Another new function is *peek*. It returns the time of the next event.
  By using peek and step together, one can easily write e.g. an interactive
  program to step through a simulation event by event.
- [NEW] A simple interactive debugger ``stepping.py`` has been added. It allows
  stepping through a simulation, with options to skip to a certain time, skip
  to the next event of a given process, or viewing the event list.
- [NEW] Versions of the Bank tutorials (documents and programs) using the
  advanced- [NEW] object-oriented API have been added.
- [NEW] A new document describes tools for gaining insight into and debugging
  SimPy models.
- [CHANGE] Major re-structuring of SimPy code, resulting in much less SimPy
  code – great for the maintainers.
- [CHANGE] Checks have been added which test whether entities belong to the
  same Simulation instance.
- [CHANGE] The Monitor and Tally methods timeAverage and timeVariance now
  calculate only with the observed time-series. No value is assumed for the
  period prior to the first observation.
- [CHANGE] Changed class Lister so that circular references between objects no
  longer lead to stack overflow and crash.
- [FIX] Functions *allEventNotices* and *allEventTimes* are working again.
- [FIX] Error messages for methods in SimPy.Lib work again.


2.0.1 – 2009-04-06
==================

- [NEW] Tests for real time behavior (testRT_Behavior.py and
  testRT_Behavior_OO.py in folder SimPy).
- [FIX] Repaired a number of coding errors in several models in the SimPyModels
  folder.
- [FIX] Repaired SimulationRT.py bug introduced by recoding for the OO API.
- [FIX] Repaired errors in sample programs in documents:

  - Simulation with SimPy - In Depth Manual
  - SimPy’s Object Oriented API Manual
  - Simulation With Real Time Synchronization Manual
  - SimPlot Manual
  - Publication-quality Plot Production With Matplotlib Manual


2.0.0 – 2009-01-26
==================

This is a major release with changes to the SimPy application programming
interface (API) and the formatting of the documentation.

API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to its existing API, SimPy now also has an object oriented API.
The additional API

- allows running SimPy in parallel on multiple processors or multi-core CPUs,
- supports better structuring of SimPy programs,
- allows subclassing of class *Simulation* and thus provides users with
  the capability of creating new simulation modes/libraries like SimulationTrace, and
- reduces the total amount of SimPy code, thereby making it easier to maintain.

Note that the OO API is **in addition** to the old API. SimPy 2.0 is fully
backward compatible.

Documentation format changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SimPy's documentation has been restructured and processed by the Sphinx
documentation generation tool. This has generated one coherent, well
structured document which can be easily browsed. A seach capability is included.


March 2008: Version 1.9.1
==========================

This is a bug-fix release which cures the following bugs:

- Excessive production of circular garbage, due to a circular reference
  between Process instances and event notices. This led to large memory
  requirements.

- Runtime error for preempts of proceeses holding multiple Resource objects.

It also adds a Short Manual, describing only the basic facilities of SimPy.

December 2007: Version 1.9
==========================

This is a major release with added functionality/new user API calls and bug fixes.

Major changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The event list handling has been changed to improve the runtime performance
  of large SimPy models (models with thousands of processes). The use of
  dictionaries for timestamps has been stopped. Thanks are due to Prof.
  Norm Matloff and a team of his students who did a study on improving
  SimPy performance. This was one of their recommendations. Thanks, Norm and guys!
  Furthermore, in version 1.9 the 'heapq' sorting package replaces 'bisect'.
  Finally, cancelling events no longer removes them, but rather marks them.
  When their event time comes, they are ignored. This was Tony Vignaux' idea!

- The Manual has been edited and given an easier-to-read layout.

- The Bank2 tutorial has been extended by models  which use more advanced
  SimPy commands/constructs.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- The tracing of 'activate' statements has been enabled.

Additions
~~~~~~~~~

- A method returning the time-weighted variance of observations
  has been added to classes Monitor and Tally.

- A shortcut activation method called "start" has been added
  to class Process.


January 2007: Version 1.8
=========================


Major Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- SimPy 1.8 and future releases will not run under the obsolete
  Python 2.2 version. They require Python 2.3 or later.

- The Manual has been thoroughly edited, restructured and rewritten.
  It is now also provided in PDF format.

- The Cheatsheet has been totally rewritten in a tabular format.
  It is provided in both XLS (MS Excel spreadsheet) and PDF format.

- The version of SimPy.Simulation(RT/Trace/Step) is now accessible
  by the variable 'version'.

- The *__str__* method of Histogram was changed to return a table format.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Repaired a bug in *yield waituntil* runtime code.

- Introduced check for *capacity* parameter of a Level or a Store
  being a number > 0.

- Added code so that self.eventsFired gets set correctly after an event fires
  in a compound yield get/put with a waitevent clause (reneging case).

- Repaired a bug in prettyprinting of Store objects.

Additions
~~~~~~~~~~

- New compound yield statements support time-out or event-based
  reneging in get and put operations on Store and Level instances.

- *yield get* on a Store instance can now have a filter function.

- All Monitor and Tally instances are automatically registered in list
  *allMonitors* and *allTallies*, respectively.

- The new function *startCollection* allows activation of Monitors and
  Tallies at a specified time.

- A *printHistogram* method was added to Tally and Monitor which generates
  a table-form histogram.

- In SimPy.SimulationRT: A function for allowing changing
  the ratio wall clock time to simulation time has been added.

June 2006: Version 1.7.1
==============================

This is a maintenance release. The API has not been changed/added to.

-   Repair of a bug in the _get methods of Store and Level which could lead to synchronization problems
    (blocking of producer processes, despite space being available in the buffer).

-   Repair of Level __init__ method to allow initialBuffered to be of either float or int type.

-   Addition of type test for Level get parameter 'nrToGet' to limit it to positive
    int or float.

-   To improve pretty-printed output of 'Level' objects, changed attribute
    '_nrBuffered' to 'nrBuffered' (synonym for 'amount' property).

-   To improve pretty-printed output of 'Store' objects, added attribute
    'buffered' (which refers to '_theBuffer' attribute).


February 2006: Version 1.7
===============================

This is a major release.

- Addition of an abstract class Buffer, with two sub-classes *Store* and *Level*
  Buffers are used for modelling inter-process synchronization in producer/
  consumer and multi-process cooperation scenarios.

- Addition of two new *yield* statements:

  + *yield put* for putting items into a buffer, and

  + *yield get* for getting items from a buffer.

- The Manual has undergone a major re-write/edit.

- All scripts have been restructured for compatibility with IronPython 1 beta2.
  This was doen by moving all *import* statements to the beginning of the scripts.
  After the removal of the first (shebang) line, all scripts (with the exception
  of plotting and GUI scripts) can run successfully under this new Python
  implementation.

September 2005: Version 1.6.1
=================================

This is a minor release.

- Addition of Tally data collection class as alternative
  to Monitor. It is intended for collecting very large data sets
  more efficiently in storage space and time than Monitor.

- Change of Resource to work with Tally (new Resource
  API is backwards-compatible with 1.6).

- Addition of function setHistogram to class Monitor for initializing
  histograms.

- New function allEventNotices() for debugging/teaching purposes. It returns
  a prettyprinted string with event times and names of process instances.

- Addition of function allEventTimes (returns event times of all scheduled
  events).

15 June 2005: Version 1.6
==============================

- Addition of two compound yield statement forms to support the modelling of
  processes reneging from resource queues.

- Addition of two test/demo files showing the use of the new reneging statements.

- Addition of test for prior simulation initialization in method activate().

- Repair of bug in monitoring thw waitQ of a resource when preemption occurs.

- Major restructuring/editing to Manual and Cheatsheet.

==================================

- MAJOR LICENSE CHANGE:

	Starting with this version 1.5.1, SimPy is being release under the GNU
	Lesser General Public License (LGPL), instead of the GNU GPL. This change
	has been made to encourage commercial firms to use SimPy in for-profit
	work.

- Minor re-release

- No additional/changed functionality

you have a basic understanding of SimPy's capabilities and that you know what
you are looking for.

- Environment (state, scheduler, attributes, event shortcuts)
- Event types (event types, event values, shared events, condition events)
- Process interaction (interrupt, passivate/reactivate, wait for proc)
- resources (resource, container, store)
- real-time simulations
- monitoring
- analyzing results (numpy, matploblib, ...)
- integration with guis
- utilitie functions (or rather describe them in "process interactions"?)

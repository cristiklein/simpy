Environments

.. currentmodule:: simpy.core

A simulation environment manages the simulation time as well as the scheduling
and processing of events. It also provides means to step through or execute the
simulation.

The base class for all environments is :class:`~simpy.core.BaseEnvironment`.
"Normal" simulations usually use its subclass
:class:`~simpy.core.Environment`. For real-time simulations, SimPy provides a
:class:`~simpy.rt.RealtimeEnvironment` (more on that in
:doc:`realtime_simulations`).

Simulation control
==================

SimPy is very flexible in terms of simulation execution. You can run your
simulation until there is no more event, until a certain simulation time is
reached, or until a certain event is triggered. You can also step through the
simulation event by event. Furthermore, you can mix these things as you like.

For example, you could run your simulation until an interesting event occurs.
You could then step through the simulation event by event for a while; and
finally run the simulation until there is no more event left and your processes
all have terminated.

The most important method here is :meth:`Environment.run()`:

- If you call it without any argument (``env.run()``), it steps through the
  simulation until there is no more event left.

  .. warning::

     If your processes run forever (``while True: yield env.timeout(1)``), this
     method will never terminate (unless you kill your script by e.g., pressing
     :kbd:`Ctrl-C`).

- In most cases it is more advisable to stop your simulation when it reaches
  a certain simulation time. Therefore, you can pass the desired time via the
  *until* parameter, e.g.: ``env.run(until=10)``.

  The simulation will then stop when the internal clock reaches 10 but will not
  process any events scheduled for time 10. This is similar to a new
  environment where the clock is 0 but (obviously) no events have yet been
  processed.

  If you want to integrate your simulation in a GUI and want to draw a
  process bar, you can repeatedly call this function with increasing *until*
  values and update your progress bar after each call:

  .. code-block:: python

     for i in range(100):
         env.run(until=i)
         progressbar.update(i)

- Instead of passing a number to ``run()``, you can also pass any event to it.
  ``run()`` will then return when the event has been processed.

  Assuming that the current time is 0, ``env.run(until=env.timeout(5))`` is
  equivalent to ``env.run(until=5)``.

  You can also pass other types of events (remember, that
  a :class:`~simpy.events.Process` is an event, too)::

     >>> import simpy
     >>>
     >>> def my_proc(env):
     ...     yield env.timeout(1)
     ...     return 'Monty Python’s Flying Circus'
     >>>
     >>> env = simpy.Environment()
     >>> proc = env.process(my_proc(env))
     >>> env.run(until=proc)
     'Monty Python’s Flying Circus'


To step through the simulation event by event, the environment offers
:meth:`~Environment.peek()` and :meth:`~Environment.step()`.

``peek()`` returns the time of the next scheduled event of *infinity*
(``float('inf')``) of no more event is scheduled.

``step()`` processes the next scheduled event. It raises an
:class:`EmptySchedule` exception if no event is available.

In a typical use case, you use these methods in a loop like:

.. code-block:: python

   until = 10
   while env.peek() < until:
      env.step()


State access
============

The environment allows you to get the current simulation time via the
:attr:`Environment.now` property. The simulation time is a number without unit
and is increased via :class:`~simpy.events.Timeout` events.

By default, ``now`` starts at 0, but you can pass an ``initial_time`` to the
:class:`Environment` to use something else.

.. note::

   Although the simulation time is technically unitless, you can pretend that
   it is, for example, in seconds and use it like a timestamp returned by
   :func:`time.time()` to calculate a date or the day of the week.

The property :attr:`Environment.active_process` is comparable to
:func:`os.getpid()` and is either ``None`` or pointing at the currently active
:class:`~simpy.events.Process`. A process is *active* when its process function
is being executed. It becomes *inactive* (or suspended) when it yields an
event.

Thus, it makes only sense to access this property from within a process
function or a function that is called by your process function::

   >>> def subfunc(env):
   ...     print(env.active_process)  # will print "p1"
   >>>
   >>> def my_proc(env):
   ...     while True:
   ...         print(env.active_process)  # will print "p1"
   ...         subfunc(env)
   ...         yield env.timeout(1)
   >>>
   >>> env = simpy.Environment()
   >>> p1 = env.process(my_proc(env))
   >>> env.active_process  # None
   >>> env.step()
   <Process(my_proc) object at 0x...>
   <Process(my_proc) object at 0x...>
   >>> env.active_process  # None

An exemplary use case for this is the resource system: If a process function
calls :meth:`~simpy.resources.resource.Resource.request()` to request
a resource, the resource determines the requesting process via
``env.active_process``. Take a `look at the code`__ to see how we do this :-).

Event creation
==============

To create events, you normally have to import :mod:`simpy.events`, instantiate
the event class and pass a reference to the environment to it. To reduce the
amount of typing, the :class:`Environment` provides some shortcuts for event
creation. For example, :meth:`Environment.event()` is equivalent to
``simpy.events.Event(env)``.

Other shortcuts are:

- :meth:`Environment.process()`
- :meth:`Environment.timeout()`
- :meth:`Environment.all_of()`
- :meth:`Environment.any_of()`

More details on what the events do can be found in the :doc:`guide to events
<events>`.


Miscellaneous
=============

Since Python 3.3, a generator function can have a return value:

.. code-block:: python

   def my_proc(env):
       yield env.timeout(1)
       return 42

In SimPy, this can be used to provide return values for processes that can be
used by other processes:

.. code-block:: python

   def other_proc(env):
       ret_val = yield env.process(my_proc(env))
       assert ret_val == 42

Internally, Python passes the return value as parameter to the
:exc:`StopIteration` exception that it raises when a generator is exhausted. So
in Python 2.7 and 3.2 you could replace the ``return 42`` with a ``raise
StopIteration(42)`` to achieve the same result.

To keep your code more readable, the environment provides the method
:meth:`~Environment.exit()` to do exactly this:

.. code-block:: python

   def my_proc(env):
       yield env.timeout(1)
       env.exit(42)  # Py2 equivalent to "return 42"

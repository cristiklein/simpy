Process communication example

Covers:

- Resources: Store

Scenario:
  This example shows how to interconnect simulation model elements
  together using :class:`~simpy.resources.store.Store` for one-to-one,
  and many-to-one asynchronous processes. For one-to-many a simple
  BroadCastPipe class is constructed from Store.

When Useful:
  When a consumer process does not always wait on a generating process
  and these processes run asynchronously. This example shows how to
  create a buffer and also tell is the consumer process was late
  yielding to the event from a generating process.

  This is also useful when some information needs to be broadcast to
  many receiving processes

  Finally, using pipes can simplify how processes are interconnected to
  each other in a simulation model.

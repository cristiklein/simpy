Documentation for SimPy
=======================

SimPy is a process-based discrete-event simulation framework based on
standard Python. It provides the modeller with components of a
simulation model including *processes*, for active components like
customers, messages, and vehicles, and *resources*, for passive
components that form limited capacity congestion points like servers,
checkout counters, and tunnels. It also provides *monitor variables*
to aid in gathering statistics. Random variates are provided by the
standard Python *random* module.

It was orignially based on ideas from *Simula 67* and *Simscript* and provides
efficient implementation of co-routines using Python's generators capability.
It requires Python 2.6 or later including Python 3.x. It was first released in
2002 under the GNU LGPL.

Documentation for SimPy
=================================

SimPy is a process-based discrete-event simulation language based on
standard Python. It provides the modeller with components of a
simulation model including *processes*, for active components like
customers, messages, and vehicles, and *resources*, for passive
components that form limited capacity congestion points like servers,
checkout counters, and tunnels. It also provides *monitor variables*
to aid in gathering statistics. Random variates are provided by the
standard Python *random* module.

It is based on ideas from Simula and Simscript and provides efficient
implementation of co-routines using Python's generators capability. It
requires Python 2.6 or later including Python 3.x. It was first
released in 2002 under the GNU LGPL.

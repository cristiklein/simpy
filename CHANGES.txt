Changelog for SimPy
===================


v2.3.1 – 2012-01-28:
--------------------

- [NEW] More improvements on the documentation.
- [FIX] Syntax error in tkconsole.py when installing on Py3.2.
- [FIX] Added *mock* to the dep. list in SimPy.test().


v2.3 – 2011-12-24:
------------------

- [NEW] Support for Python 3.2. Support for Python <= 2.5 has been dropped.
- [NEW] SimPy.test() method to run the tests on the installed version of SimPy.
– [NEW] Tutorials/examples were integrated into the test suite.
– [CHANGE] Even more code clean-up (e.g., removed prints throughout the code,
  removed if-main-blocks, ...).
- [CHANGE] Many documentation improvements.


v2.2 – 2011-09-27:
------------------

- [CHANGE] Restructured package layout to be conform to the `Hitchhiker’s Guide
  to packaging <http://guide.python-distribute.org/>`_
- [CHANGE] Tests have been ported to pytest.
- [CHANGE] Documentation improvements and clean-ups.
- [FIX] Fixed incorrect behavior of Store._put, thanks to Johannes Koomer for
  the fix.


v2.1 – 2010-06-03:
------------------

- [NEW] A function *step* has been added to the API. When called, it executes
  the next scheduled event. (*step* is actually a method of *Simulation*.)
- [NEW] Another new function is *peek*. It returns the time of the next event.
  By using peek and step together, one can easily write e.g. an interactive
  program to step through a simulation event by event.
- [NEW] A simple interactive debugger ``stepping.py`` has been added. It allows
  stepping through a simulation, with options to skip to a certain time, skip
  to the next event of a given process, or viewing the event list.
- [NEW] Versions of the Bank tutorials (documents and programs) using the
  advanced- [NEW] object-oriented API have been added.
- [NEW] A new document describes tools for gaining insight into and debugging
  SimPy models.
- [CHANGE] Major re-structuring of SimPy code, resulting in much less SimPy
  code – great for the maintainers.
- [CHANGE] Checks have been added which test whether entities belong to the
  same Simulation instance.
- [CHANGE] The Monitor and Tally methods timeAverage and timeVariance now
  calculate only with the observed time-series. No value is assumed for the
  period prior to the first observation.
- [CHANGE] Changed class Lister so that circular references between objects no
  longer lead to stack overflow and crash.
- [FIX] Functions *allEventNotices* and *allEventTimes* are working again.
- [FIX] Error messages for methods in SimPy.Lib work again.


v2.0.1 – 2009-04-06:
--------------------

- [NEW] Tests for real time behavior (testRT_Behavior.py and
  testRT_Behavior_OO.py in folder SimPy).
- [FIX] Repaired a number of coding errors in several models in the SimPyModels
  folder.
- [FIX] Repaired SimulationRT.py bug introduced by recoding for the OO API.
- [FIX] Repaired errors in sample programs in documents:

  - Simulation with SimPy - In Depth Manual
  - SimPy’s Object Oriented API Manual
  - Simulation With Real Time Synchronization Manual
  - SimPlot Manual
  - Publication-quality Plot Production With Matplotlib Manual


v2.0.0 - 2009-01-26:
--------------------

- [NEW] In addition to its existing API, SimPy now also has an object oriented
  API.

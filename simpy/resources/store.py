"""
Shared resources for storing a possibly unlimited amount of objects supporting
requests for specific objects.

The :class:`Store` operates in a FIFO (first-in, first-out) order. Objects are
retrieved from the store in the order they were put in. The *get* requests of a
:class:`FilterStore` can be customized by a filter to only retrieve objects
matching a given criterion.

SimPy supports three primitives to share and synchronize the use of resources
between processes:


.. autosummary::

    ~simpy.resources.resource
    ~simpy.resources.container
    ~simpy.resources.store

All of these modules are derived from the base classes in the
:mod:`~simpy.resources.base`. The classes in this module is also meant to
support the implementation of custom resource primitives.

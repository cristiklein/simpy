"""
SimPy implements three types of resources that can be used to synchronize
processes or to model congestion points:

.. autosummary::

    ~simpy.resources.resource
    ~simpy.resources.container
    ~simpy.resources.store

They are derived from the base classes defined in the
:mod:`~simpy.resources.base` module. These classes are also meant to support
the implementation of custom resource types.
